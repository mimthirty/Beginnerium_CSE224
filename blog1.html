                        <p class="mb-30">Kneaded erasers don't really dry out, not like a wet kitchen sponge 
                            dries out if you leave it on the counter. They aren't oily, either, like plasticine is. 
                            Kneaded erasers do not shed noodles the way pink or white erasers doâ€¦ 
                            rather than shedding the graphite/charcoal, they absorb It.Subsequently, 
                            question is, how long does a Kneadable eraser last? Such erasers tend to 
                            last longer than other varieties and can be used for years. You may notice 
                            that instead of erasing, it leaves dirty marks on the paper. If kneading doesn't result in cleaning anymore, and your eraser 
                            is not able to accumulate more graphite, it is time to look for a replacement.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30"><h4>How Long Do Kneaded Erasers Last?
                        </h4></p>
                        <p class="mb-30">One of the great things about a putty eraser is its longevity. Most erasers lose tiny amounts each time that they are used. This is normal, and those tiny bits that rub off don't seem like a big deal, and they aren't. That's how erasers work. But, each tiny amount that comes off of an eraser during each use adds up, and over time an eraser will start to shrink. 

                            It may not be a fast process, but the cumulative effect of a lost eraser adds up to you needing to buy a new eraser at some point. Kneaded erasers are different than traditional erasers because they don't rub off when you use them. Since you don't lose bits of the eraser during each use, your eraser won't shrink, so you won't have to worry about replacing it because it becomes too small to use. </p>
                        <p class="mb-30"><h4>How Can I Make my Kneaded Eraser Soft Again?
                        </h4></p>
                        <p class="mb-30">While exposing your eraser to excessive heat is bad for it, a moderate amount of heat will actually 
                            help to keep it pliant and usable. How do you warm up a kneaded eraser safely? Well, using a microwave, an oven, 
                            or any other external heat source like this is out of the question. What you can do is begin to knead your eraser. 

                            Stretch it out over and over again and knead it together. You'll have to be patient because a hard, 
                            brittle eraser will take some time to become pliant again, but it will happen. Once your eraser begins 
                            to become more pliant, you'll also notice that it's getting warmer. This is because you are imparting 
                            mechanical energy into it by working it, which helps it become softer and more flexible.
                            
                            What happens if your kneaded eraser is so hard that it breaks when you try to knead it? That's no problem; 
                            you can simply push the two broken pieces back together again and start the process of kneading them until they become pliable. 
                            
                            But, what do you do if your kneaded eraser is so hard that you can't bend or break it? In this case, you can use a sharp knife 
                            and cut the eraser into pieces. Be careful when doing this, so you don't slip and cut yourself. The best way to do this is to put the erase down on a hard surface and then use a heavy knife while applying steady downward pressure. Once it breaks, you can start to try to knead the pieces back together again. 
                            If all else fails, don't forget, you can always buy a replacement for a few dollars. </p>

                        <p class="mb-30">Usually, you can revive the lumpy acrylic paint if you can still get the paint out the tube. Since acrylics 
                            are water-based, you can add water and mix it into the paint using a palette knife until you develop a better consistency. 
                            Be sure not to mix in too much water, which could compromise the paint coverage and color. Too much water could also cause 
                            your paint to lift off the canvas once it's dried. 

                          Also, water becomes ineffective if the acrylic paint is rock hard. In this case, you can try to rework the paint with a clear acrylic base. To prevent the paint from drying in the first place,</p>
                        <p class="mb-30"><h4>How Do you Preserve a Kneaded Eraser?</h4></p>
                        <p class="mb-30">The best way to preserve a putty rubber is to regularly clean it. No, you can't 
                            use soap and water. But, what you can do is stretch and knead the eraser in your hands. When you do this, 
                            you'll notice that your hands are getting dirty. 

                            Trapped graphite or charcoal particles are being worked out of the eraser and end up on your hands. 
                            All you have to do is stretch the eraser, then knead it back together again. After a while, 
                            you should notice that the dark color of the eraser is lighter. That's how you know that it's cleaner. 
                            The longevity of your eraser needs to clean it this way regularly. 
                            It's also important because a dirty eraser will leave marks behind on your paper, which is not what you want an eraser to do.</p>
                        <p class="mb-30">The other key to preserving an eraser is to avoid exposing it to heat. Kneaded erasers are made of a soft, pliant, 
                            rubber-like material. If they become too hot and dry, they will become more brittle and begin to crack. Can you save an eraser once 
                            it's gotten to this point? Most of the time, you can. But it's a lot easier to avoid drying out your eraser than it is to try to 
                            restore one that's become too hard and brittle.

                            Taking care of a kneaded eraser is all about common sense. You want your eraser to remain soft and pliant, right? Well, then 
                            store it in a cool, dry place. You should also stretch and knead it regularly; this keeps the erase from stiffening up and 
                            cracking. Pay attention to your eraser. When it looks dirty, stretch and knead it. If it looks like it's cracking, stretches and knead it. 
                            In other words, if you're not sure what to do, stretch and knead it.</p>
